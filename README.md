A basic iOS app to search words and its corresponding definition.

## What I used/learned from this side project

- Custom, programmatic and reusable controls (to avoid the "massive ViewController problem").
- Dark/Light mode detection and support.
- JSON decoding using `Codable`.
- Swift extensions.
- Storyboards.
- Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Future improvements

- Refactor using MVP pattern.
- Refactor using MVVM pattern with RxSwift.
- Unit testing.
- Apply SwiftLint.
- SwiftUI in replacement of Storyboards.
